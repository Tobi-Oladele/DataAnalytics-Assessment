 âœ… Question 1: Identify Customers with Savings and Investment Plans
 ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Identify users who have both savings and investment plans and calculate their total confirmed deposit across savings accounts.
  ðŸ§  Approach
- Performed a `UNION ALL` between:
  - One query calculating deposits
  - One query counting plan types
- Grouped the results by user ID and name
- Filtered for customers with **at least one savings and one investment plan**
- Sorted by highest total deposits

âœ…  Question 2: Frequency of Transactions
ðŸŽ¯Objective
Classify users by how often they transact into High, Medium, or Low Frequency tiers.
ðŸ§  Approach
Calculated monthly transaction frequency using total transactions / number of months active.
Used a CASE statement to assign a frequency category.
Grouped the results to count users and compute average transaction frequency per category.


âœ… Question 3: Detect Inactive Accounts (No Inflow in 1 Year)
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Identify all active users who havenâ€™t made any inflow transactions in the last 365 days.
ðŸ§  Approach
Created a CTE active_user from users marked is_active = 1.
Calculated the last transaction date per plan and computed days since last transaction.
Filtered for active users in the final result.


 âœ… Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Estimate each user's potential lifetime value based on tenure and confirmed deposits.
ðŸ§  Approach
Calculated tenure in months using TIMESTAMPDIFF().
Computed total deposits per user.
Estimated CLV as monthly average Ã— 12 Ã— conversion factor (0.001).
